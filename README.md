# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to Advent of Code 2018


### Notes

The solutions in go can either be run by running `go build` and then running the executable that is produced (for example, `go build && ./part-2-alt` if inside the `go/day-1/part-2-alt` folder), or by simply running `go run part2.go`, if inside the same folder.
